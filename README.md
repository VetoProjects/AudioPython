An audio module for Python that is included in a Live Coding Environment I currently work on;
it is based on [wavebender](https://github.com/zacharydenton/wavebender/) and relies heavily
on such constructs as itertools, generators and lambdas, all in all it is based on the
functional parts of Python - Guido would hate it. Note that it is in development and
not really usable up until now although you can create really neat sounds if you work really
hard.

Requirements
------------

All you need is a working Python installation. It works on all versions from 2.5 to 3.4, as 
far as I know. Travis says so, at least.

I personally only use 2.7 and 3.3 at the moment, so I am always interessant in feedback regarding
version support.

Installation
------------

Installation is quite simple. First, you'll have to navigate into the dir and install the 
library via `python setup.py install` as usual. To test your installation(you really might want
to do that), run `nosetests`. This might take a moment - it takes about 15 seconds on my 4GB RAM
Macbook.

AudioPython is also available as a autogenerated shared library in C(yay, Cython). Just run
`make cython && make all && make install` and it is available for you. I have basically never 
used it yet and cannot say anything about its behaviour nor whether it really works as expected. 
To be honest, that is not really a priority right now.

Usage
-----

To use the library, first do your usual

```python
import AudioPython
```

If you are already familiar with wavebender, the transition should be mostly smooth.
The thing that might confuse at first is that there are several submodules to AudioPython
that were not present in wavebender. A short list to what is there and how to use it:

**dsp**:

This submodule contains the basic waveform: sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, damped, 
white noise and a leaky integrator.

**effects**:

This submodule contains a few basic effects, such as lowpass and highpass and a biquadfilter;
also delay, flanger and chorus are in there.

**instruments**:

This submodule contains more "high level" interfaces, such as make_melody(which creates a melody
from frequencies), concat_melodies, a hammond organ, a leslie flanger, a regular one, a delay,
a chorus, a random progression function if you want to get freaky, and a make_instrument function
which creates an instrument from a directory of samples. You can get those samples with the function
get_sample afterwards.

**util**:

This submodule contains mostly internal functions.

**wave**:

This submodule also contains mostly internal functions for encoding sound as wave files.
This is largely based on wavebender, only experimental Python 3 support is my work. And that
is not functional yet. So, basically, I did nothing to it.

Examples
--------

I included a examples directory where some of the most useful features are shown. You can tweak them
and experiment with them, they should be a little introduction.

Contribute
----------

This work is potentially never-ending. DSPs, Sound Effects, Instruments, all of them can
be produced in AudioPython and a few of them will be.

I personally am engaged in a reverb and a ringbuffer, but I found new things I want to add every few
days, so I am not really likely to stick to my schedule.

Also, some of the functions(especially the ones involving real samples) are basically untested and 
need to be tested. Sadly, I am not very creative at the moment, which means I cannot come up with 
enough ways to break my code. You can do that for me, if you want to. Even better if you can fix it 
afterwards, but if you cannot or do not want to, just drop me a few lines so I know the problem exists.
