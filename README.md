AudioPython
===========

An audio module for Python that is included in a Live Coding Environment I currently work on;
it is based on [wavebender](https://github.com/zacharydenton/wavebender/) and relies heavily
on such constructs as itertools, generators and lambdas, all in all it is based on the
functional parts of Python - Guido would hate it. Note that it is in development and
not really usable up until now although you can create really neat sounds if you work really
hard.

Requirements
------------

The library is based on Python2.7. Even though I work on support for Python3.x, it is not
working, because I have problems with Pythons `struct` module. So at the moment all you need
is a working installation of Python. 

I have not yet concocted setuptools integration, because it really is a subproject for 
[a live coding editor](https://github.com/hellerve/Veto-LiveCoding) I am currently working on. 
The module is very well integrated there and should work pretty good. Try it out!
