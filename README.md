AudioPython
===========

An audio module for Python that is included in a Live Coding Environment I currently work on;
it is based on [wavebender](https://github.com/zacharydenton/wavebender/) and relies heavily
on such constructs as itertools, generators and lambdas. Note that it is in development and
not really usable up until now although you can create really neat sounds if you work really
hard.

If you wait a few weeks, it might become something useful. :)
